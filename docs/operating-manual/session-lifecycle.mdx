## Session Lifecycle

Every working session follows this pattern. All agents MUST follow this regardless of provider (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Grok).

### START

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (global + project) — this file is the constitution
2. Read `docs/DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md` — this file is the methodology
3. Read `.dfw/personal-config.md` — environment-specific paths and mappings
4. **Check for active state file.** Read `.dfw/session-state.json` (or `X:\DFW\Tools\.dfw-state\` for kickstart). If a state file exists with incomplete steps, **resume from `lastCompletedStep`** — do not re-execute completed steps, do not re-ask questions stored in the `inputs` field. See [State Protocol](/operating-manual/state-protocol) for full protocol.
5. Read `context/_ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` — understand current state
6. Read `plans/_TODO.md` — understand priorities and active tasks
7. Understand current state before doing anything

### WORK

8. Execute against the plan
9. Persist all artifacts to the correct DFW directories (see [Directory Structure](/operating-manual/directory-structure))
10. Apply proper tags to all tasks and artifacts (see [Tagging System](/operating-manual/tagging))
11. When ambiguity arises — STOP, ask, record with `#source/ambiguity #route/dfw` (P3)
12. For multi-step operations, update the state file after each completed step (see [State Protocol](/operating-manual/state-protocol))

### CLOSE

13. Update `context/_ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md` with what was accomplished and what's next
14. Update `plans/_TODO.md`:
    - Completed tasks → `#status/done` + `@completed()` timestamp
    - Discovered tasks → new entry with `#status/backlog #priority/<level> #source/session`
15. If significant work: create or suggest a journal entry in the Obsidian vault
16. If tool transition needed: write a handoff to `prompts/handoffs/`
17. If a state file exists and all steps are complete, archive it (see [State Protocol](/operating-manual/state-protocol))

### FLYWHEEL FEEDBACK

18. Did we hit methodology friction? → Tag `#source/dfw-feedback #route/dfw`
19. Did ambiguity arise? → Already auto-routed via `#source/ambiguity #route/dfw` (step 11)
20. Did a rule fail or prove insufficient? → Propose an amendment with rationale
21. Did we discover a reusable pattern? → Capture it as a skill

## Artifact Sequencing Convention

All persisted artifacts (except structural `_` files) follow this naming convention:

**Pattern:** `NNN-type-slug.md`
- `NNN` = 3-digit zero-padded sequence number (001, 002, 003...)
- `type` = artifact type (see table below)
- `slug` = kebab-case descriptive name

| Type | Used For | Target Directory |
|------|----------|------------------|
| `plan` | Plans, roadmaps, sprint plans | `plans/` |
| `spec` | Specifications, requirements | `docs/` |
| `doc` | General documentation, guides | `docs/` |
| `adr` | Architecture Decision Records | `docs/` |
| `prompt` | Reusable prompts, system prompts | `prompts/` |
| `handoff` | Context handoffs between tools/sessions | `prompts/` |
| `research` | Research findings, literature reviews | `research/` |
| `analysis` | Analysis, deep dives | `research/` |
| `retro` | Retrospectives, post-session learnings | `context/` |
| `context` | Active context snapshots | `context/` |
| `decision` | Decision records | `context/` |
| `journal` | Journal entries, session logs | `context/` |

**Sequencing rules:**
- Per-directory independent counters
- Before creating, scan the directory and use `(max NNN) + 1`
- Never reuse a sequence number
- Directory names are ALWAYS lowercase

**Required frontmatter:**
