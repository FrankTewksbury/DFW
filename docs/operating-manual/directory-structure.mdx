## DFW Standard Directory Structure

Every DFW project MUST have this directory structure. The DFW Extension scaffolds it automatically. If adopting an existing project, these directories MUST be created.

```
<project-root>/
├── .dfw/                    # DFW metadata — project identity, constitution
│   ├── project.json         # Project manifest (name, type, version, DFW version)
│   ├── constitution.json    # Project-level rules (tool conventions, naming)
