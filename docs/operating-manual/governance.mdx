## Constitution Amendment Process

<Note>
**PLACEHOLDER — To be expanded**
</Note>

Covers how DFW principles and rules get changed:
- Who can propose an amendment (any agent or human)
- What rationale is required
- Where amendment history is tracked
- How amendments propagate to fraternal twins (CLAUDE.md ↔ agent-constitution.mdc)
- Version numbering convention

## Cross-Agent Compatibility

<Note>
**PLACEHOLDER — To be expanded**
</Note>

Covers how non-Claude agents consume DFW rules:

| Agent | Method |
|-------|--------|
| **Claude Code** | Auto-reads CLAUDE.md natively |
| **Claude Desktop** | Bootstrap via Custom Instructions (see CLAUDE.md Section 8) |
| **Cursor** | Reads `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (fraternal twin) |
| **Gemini** | Requires system prompt injection — paste DFW section or provide file path |
| **GPT / Codex** | Requires system prompt injection or project knowledge upload |
| **Grok** | Requires system prompt injection |
| **API-based agents** | Include CLAUDE.md content in system prompt |

The file stays named CLAUDE.md for Claude Code auto-loading. For non-Claude agents, provide this file's content via whatever system prompt or project knowledge mechanism the agent supports.
