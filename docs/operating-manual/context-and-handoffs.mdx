## Context Preservation — The MUST DOs

Context is currency (P1). These are non-negotiable actions that preserve it:

**`context/_ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`** — The single most important file in any DFW project.
- MUST be read at the start of every session.
- MUST be updated at the end of every session with: what was done, what's next, what's blocked.
- This is how sessions hand off to each other. Without it, the next session starts cold.

**`plans/_TODO.md`** — The living task list.
- MUST be read at session start to understand priorities.
- MUST be updated when tasks are completed, added, or re-prioritized.
- Every task MUST have `#status/` and `#priority/` tags (see Section 4).
- Completed tasks MUST have `#status/done` and `@completed()` timestamps.
- New tasks discovered mid-session get `#status/backlog #priority/<level> #source/session`.

**`context/_DECISIONS_LOG.md`** — Why we chose what we chose.
- MUST be appended when a significant architectural, design, or tooling decision is made.
- Entries include: the decision, alternatives considered, rationale, and date.

**Sequenced artifacts** — Everything else persisted with `NNN-type-slug.md` naming (see [Artifact Sequencing](/operating-manual/session-lifecycle#artifact-sequencing-convention)).

## Handoff Protocol

Every tool transition and every session boundary requires a handoff. The handoff is how context survives tool boundaries and session gaps.

A handoff MUST include:
- **Context:** What was done, what state are we in, what decisions were made
- **Intent:** What needs to happen next and why
- **Constraints:** What must not change, what boundaries apply
- **Acceptance:** How will we know the next phase succeeded
- **Files:** Which files are involved, where they are
- **Open Questions:** What's unresolved — tag each with `#source/ambiguity #route/dfw` if it represents a methodology gap

Handoffs live in `prompts/handoffs/` with the naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>-handoff.md`
