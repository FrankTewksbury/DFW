## Fit-for-Purpose Tool Assignments

Each tool has a defined role. Using a tool outside its purpose creates friction. When friction is identified, tag it `#source/dfw-feedback #route/dfw`.

| Tool | Primary Role | Use For | Don't Use For |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Claude Desktop** | Planning, synthesis, research, reasoning | Architecture decisions, prompt design, research, session planning, journal writing, Obsidian/Notion interaction | Code execution, file editing, CI/CD |
| **Cursor** | Flow-state implementation | Code writing, inline edits, visual diffs, debugging, frontend work | Long autonomous runs, documentation generation, research |
| **Claude Code** | Autonomous multi-file operations | Large refactors, test generation, parallel execution, scripting, CI/CD | Visual editing, flow-state coding, architecture planning |
| **Obsidian** | Long-term memory and global state | Journals, cross-project search, tag routing, methodology docs, project stubs | Code editing, real-time collaboration, project deliverables |
| **Notion** | External-facing content and team collaboration | Roadmaps, meeting notes, stakeholder comms, pitch materials | Development state, code handoffs, personal workflow |
