## Journal System

Journals are the long-term memory of the project portfolio. They live in the Obsidian vault at the global scope.

- **Location:** `journal/YYYY-MM-DD_<Slug>.md`
- **Content:** Executive summary, sessions breakdown, artifacts created, decisions made, carried-forward items, key insights, reflection
- **When:** After any session with significant outcomes — always ASK before creating (P2)
- **Purpose:** Future sessions reference journals to understand history, patterns, and decisions
- **Tags in journals:** Journal entries SHOULD include relevant `#source/` and `#route/` tags to aid future search and routing

## The Flywheel Effect

This is why it's called Development Flywheel:

1. Every session produces artifacts (context, decisions, handoffs, retros)
2. Those artifacts inform the next session (no cold starts)
3. Methodology friction gets tagged `#source/dfw-feedback #route/dfw` and enters the DFW project backlog
4. Ambiguity gaps get tagged `#source/ambiguity #route/dfw` and enter the DFW backlog
5. DFW improvements ship → all projects benefit
6. Better projects generate higher-level friction → repeat at a higher level

Two feedback loops run simultaneously:
- **Inner loop:** Project work → project board → operational improvement
- **Outer loop:** Product work → DFW board → methodology improvement

The flywheel only works if:
- Context is preserved (P1) — every session ends with updated `_ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`
- Artifacts are persisted (Section 5) — nothing lives only in chat
- Tags are applied (Section 4) — everything is findable and trackable
- Feedback closes the loop (P6) — friction becomes improvement, not frustration
