### 4.1 Never Delete — Always Archive

<Warning>
**CRITICAL RULE: Files are NEVER deleted. They are archived.**
</Warning>

When a file needs to be removed, replaced, or superseded:

1. Create an `archive/` directory in the **project root** (or subproject root if applicable)
2. Move the file into `archive/` **preserving the original directory structure** so files with the same name from different directories are not overwritten
3. Example: archiving `docs/old-spec.md` → `archive/docs/old-spec.md`
4. Example: archiving `plans/_TODO.md` → `archive/plans/_TODO.md`

**Never use `rm`, `del`, `unlink`, or any destructive file operation on project files.**
**Never overwrite a file without first archiving the previous version if the content change is substantial.**

Quick formatting fixes, typo corrections, and appending content do NOT require archiving.
Structural rewrites, file replacements, and major content changes DO require archiving first.

### 4.2 Restricted Directories

<Warning>
**CRITICAL RULE: Some directories and files are HUMAN-ONLY.**
</Warning>

**NEVER read, write, list, or access:**

- Any directory named `secrets/`, `secret/`, `.secrets/`
- Any directory named `ENV/` or `.env/` (the directory, not .env files in project root)
- Any directory named `credentials/`, `creds/`, `.credentials/`
- Any directory named `keys/`, `.keys/`
- Any file matching `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.pfx`, `*.p12`
- Any file named `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, or similar SSH key patterns
- AWS credentials files (`~/.aws/credentials`)
- Any file the user explicitly marks as restricted

**`.env` files in the project root:** You may READ these to understand configuration structure, but NEVER log, display, or repeat actual secret values (API keys, tokens, passwords). You may reference variable NAMES only.

If you encounter a secret value in any context, redact it immediately: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-REDACTED`

### 4.3 Target Directory — Security Boundary

<Warning>
**CRITICAL RULE: All AI-accessible paths MUST be within the Target Directory.**
</Warning>

The Target Directory (e.g., `C:\Projects`, `D:\Projects`) is the outermost
boundary for AI tool access. It is set during environment initialization and
recorded in `personal-config.md`.

- ALL MCP filesystem server paths MUST resolve to locations within the Target Directory.
- ALL project directories created by scaffolding MUST be within the Target Directory.
- The Obsidian vault MUST be within the Target Directory.
- Agents MUST NOT request, suggest, or accept filesystem access to any path
  outside the Target Directory, even if the user explicitly asks.
- The scaffold protocol (Operating Manual Section 18) MUST validate that the
  project path is within the Target Directory before proceeding.

This rule provides **structural enforcement** of the Secrets Are Sacred rule (4.2).
Behavioral rules can be forgotten or bypassed; directory containment cannot.
