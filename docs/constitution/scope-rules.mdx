<Note>
**Enforceable rule. Follow it in every session.**
</Note>

**Obsidian vault = GLOBAL scope only.**
**Project directories = LOCAL scope — all project work product.**

### What Goes in Obsidian (Global)

| Directory | Content | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `projects/<n>/` | **Lightweight stub ONLY** | Status, link to project dir, last session date |
| `journal/` | Daily journals spanning all projects | Session summaries, cross-project notes |
| `meta/` | Cross-project rules, conventions, methodology | Scope rules, tag taxonomy, DFW glossary |

### What Goes in the Project Directory (Local)

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| `docs/` | Specs, architecture, ADRs, overview, glossary, constitution, operating manual |
| `plans/` | TODO, wishlist, roadmap |
| `prompts/` | System prompts, handoffs, templates |
| `context/` | Active context, decisions, retros |
| `research/` | Research artifacts |
| `scripts/` | Automation, hooks |
| `app/`, `src/`, `tests/` | Code |

### Violation Check

Before writing ANY file, ask yourself:
1. Is this about a specific project's deliverable? → Write to project directory
2. Is this a journal, methodology doc, or cross-project reference? → Obsidian is OK
3. Am I unsure? → Ask the user (P3)
