## Step 0: Choose Your Target Directory

Before anything else, decide on a **single root directory** that will contain ALL DFW projects, the Obsidian vault, and the Tools repo. This directory is the **security boundary** — AI tools will ONLY have filesystem access within it.

```powershell
# The setup script will create this for you. Examples:
# C:\Projects     D:\Projects     X:\Projects
```

<Warning>
**Rules for the Target Directory:**
- All MCP filesystem server paths MUST point inside this directory
- All project directories MUST be created inside this directory
- The Obsidian vault MUST be inside this directory
- NEVER point MCP servers at paths above the Target Directory
- This prevents AI agents from accessing SSH keys, credentials, browser profiles, or anything outside the containment boundary
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **PowerShell 7.0+** | Yes | [Download](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) — Windows ships with 5.1, which is **NOT** sufficient |
| **Git** | Yes | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) — auto-installed by `Start-Here.ps1` via winget if missing |
| **Node.js** (LTS) | Yes | [Download](https://nodejs.org) — auto-installed by `Start-Here.ps1` via winget if missing |
| **Obsidian** | Yes | [Download](https://obsidian.md) — free, no account required |
| **Claude Desktop** | Yes | [Download](https://claude.ai/download) |
| **Cursor** | Yes | [Download](https://cursor.com) |

### Obsidian Plugin Requirements

Obsidian requires two community plugins for DFW integration:

| Plugin | ID | Purpose |
|--------|----|---------|
| **Local REST API** | `obsidian-local-rest-api` | Bridge between Claude Desktop and your vault |
| **MCP Tools** | `mcp-tools` | MCP server integration for Obsidian |

<Info>
- Obsidian must be **running** whenever Claude Desktop needs vault access.
- After installing Local REST API, generate an API key in its settings — you'll need it for the Claude Desktop config.
- Verify the REST API is working by opening `http://localhost:27124` in a browser.

## Important: Drive Mappings and MCP

If you use Windows `subst` to map a drive letter (e.g., `X:` → `C:\DATA`), be aware that MCP filesystem servers do **not** resolve drive aliases. Always configure MCP with the **real path** (`C:\DATA\...`), not the mapped drive letter (`X:\...`).

<Warning>
MCP servers use string matching, not filesystem resolution. A path like `X:\Projects\DFW` will fail even if `X:` is a valid `subst` mapping. Always use the underlying real path in all MCP configuration.
</Warning>
