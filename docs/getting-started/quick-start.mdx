## Two Commands

Open PowerShell 7+ and run:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/FrankTewksbury/DFW.git
.\DFW\Start-Here.ps1
```

That's it. The script handles the rest.

## What the Script Does

`Start-Here.ps1` performs six steps automatically:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Check prerequisites** — installs Git and Node.js via winget if missing |
| 2 | **Ask for your drive letter** — where the Target Directory will live |
| 3 | **Create directories** — sets up `<drive>:\Projects\` and clones DFW there |
| 4 | **Clone and scaffold** — creates the Obsidian vault and scaffolds the DFWP meta-project |
| 5 | **Generate config** — produces a ready-to-use `claude-desktop-config.json` |
| 6 | **Print next steps** — displays step-by-step instructions to finish setup |

After the script completes, follow the [Full Setup Guide](/getting-started/setup-guide) for Obsidian plugin installation, API key setup, and Claude Desktop configuration.

<Warning>
**After editing `claude_desktop_config.json`, you MUST fully quit and relaunch Claude Desktop.**

Close from the **system tray** — not just the window. MCP config changes are only loaded at startup. Closing the window leaves Claude running in the background with the old config.
</Warning>
