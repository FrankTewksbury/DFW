# DFW — Development Flywheel Infrastructure

The shared infrastructure for the DFW methodology. Clone this repo and run `Start-Here.ps1` to bootstrap a complete DFW environment on any Windows machine.

## What is DFW?

**DFW = Development Flywheel.** It is the project management and development lifecycle methodology that governs all work in this ecosystem. Every project. Every session. Every agent.

DFW is not a framework, not a library, not a product. It is the **operating methodology** — the standard process for how projects are created, managed, built, tracked, and improved.

The **Flywheel Effect**: every session, every project, and every artifact makes the next one better. Context accumulates; it is never discarded.

## What's Inside

- `Start-Here.ps1` — **Run this first.** One-script bootstrap for the entire DFW environment
- `Tools/` — Constitution, operating manual, rules, scripts, and seed templates
  - `Constitution/` — DFW-CONSTITUTION.md, glossary, CLAUDE templates, personal-config template
  - `Manuals/` — DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md
  - `Model/` — Claude-specific model file (CLAUDE.md)
  - `rules/` — Cursor `.mdc` rule files (fraternal twins of the constitution)
  - `scripts/` — Bootstrap, Resync, and CardBoard sync scripts
  - `templates/` — Seed files for vault, DFWP project, and Claude Desktop config
  - `docs/` — Setup guide and reference documentation

## What's NOT Inside (generated locally)

- `Vault/` — Obsidian vault (`.gitignored`, created by bootstrap script)
- `claude-desktop-config.json` — Generated by `Start-Here.ps1` (`.gitignored`, contains your paths)
