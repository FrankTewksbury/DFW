# DFW Manuals

This directory contains operational manual templates for the DevFlywheel methodology.

When a new DFW project is scaffolded, manuals are copied into the project's `docs/` directory.

## Contents

| File | Copied To | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md` | `docs/DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md` | Complete DFW methodology — tagging, session lifecycle, handoffs, sequencing, tools |

## How It Gets There

- **DFW Extension:** `DFW: New Project` auto-copies during scaffolding
- **DFW Extension:** `DFW: Sync Tools` offers it as an importable/refreshable item
- **Manual:** Copy the file into your project's `docs/` directory
