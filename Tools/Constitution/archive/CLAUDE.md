## 1. Constitution

These eight principles define the project's values. Every rule below derives from them.

| # | Principle | Meaning |
|---|-----------|---------|
| P1 | **Context Is Currency** | Never lose context between sessions or tools. Persist everything. |
| P2 | **Humans Steer, AI Executes** | Frank sets direction. Agents execute. Never make autonomous decisions about project direction, architecture, or scope. |
| P3 | **Explicit Over Implicit** | Write it down, sequence it, make it findable. No tribal knowledge. |
| P4 | **Small, Composable Units** | Artifacts are modular and independently useful. Prefer many small files over monoliths. |
| P5 | **Feedback Closes the Loop** | When something fails, ask why. Retrospectives and journal entries feed continuous improvement. |
| P6 | **Scope Boundaries Are Sacred** | Root-global, subproject-local. Don't bleed concerns across boundaries. |
| P7 | **Tools Are Fit-for-Purpose** | Right tool for the right job. Claude Desktop for planning/synthesis, Cursor for implementation, Claude Code for terminal execution. |
| P8 | **Measure Before Optimizing** | Don't optimize what you haven't measured. |
