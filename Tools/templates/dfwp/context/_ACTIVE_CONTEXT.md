# DFWP — Active Context

## Current State (as of {{DATE}})

Fresh DFWP project scaffolded by DFW bootstrap.

### What's Next

1. Open this project in Cursor with the DFW workspace
2. Configure Claude Desktop MCP paths
3. Create your first plan or start working

## Key Artifacts

| Artifact | Location |
|----------|----------|
| DFW-CONSTITUTION.md | `docs/DFW-CONSTITUTION.md` |
| CLAUDE.md | Project root `CLAUDE.md` |
| DFW Operating Manual | `docs/DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md` |
| Personal Config | `.dfw/personal-config.md` |

## Decisions in Effect

- `DFW-CONSTITUTION.md` is the universal behavioral authority
- `CLAUDE.md` is the Claude-specific entry point
- Personal config is environment-specific — NOT committed to git
