# DFW — Development Flywheel Infrastructure

The shared infrastructure for the DFW methodology. Clone this repo to bootstrap a complete DFW environment on any machine.

## What's Inside

- `Tools/` — Constitution, operating manual, rules, scripts, and seed templates
  - `Constitution/` — DFW-CONSTITUTION.md, glossary, CLAUDE templates, personal-config template
  - `Manuals/` — DFW-OPERATING-MANUAL.md
  - `Model/` — Claude-specific model file (CLAUDE.md)
  - `rules/` — Cursor `.mdc` rule files (fraternal twins of the constitution)
  - `scripts/` — Bootstrap, Resync, and CardBoard sync scripts
  - `templates/` — Seed files for vault and DFWP project initialization

## What's NOT Inside (generated locally)

- `Vault/` — Obsidian vault (`.gitignored`, created by bootstrap script)
